### 문제 설명

<p>Mirko's latest homework assignment is writing an essay. However, he finds writing essays so boring that, after working for two hours, he realized that all he has written are N long words consisting entirely of letters A and B. Having accepted that he will never finish the essay in time, poor Mirko has decided to at least have some fun with it by counting nice words. </p>

<p>Mirko is connecting pairs of identical letters (A with A, B with B) by drawing arches above the word. A given word is nice if each letter can be connected to exactly one other letter in such a way that no two arches intersect. Help Mirko count how many words are nice. </p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of input contains the positive integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100), the number of words written down by Mirko. </p>

<p>Each of the following N lines contains a single word consisting of letters A and B, with length between 2 and 100 000, inclusive. The sum of lengths of all words doesn't exceed 1 000 000.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>The first and only line of output must contain the number of nice words. </p>
